#  The Energy Cost of Intelligence: An Empirical Comparison of On-Device vs Remote LLM Processing on Mobile Devices | Group 8 Green Lab
This repository is a companion page for the Green Lab project of Moriah Owens, Sonu Sagar, Kris Saliba, Luca Ratan, and Presiyan Penkov at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

It contains all the material required for replicating the study, including the on-device condition, the remote condition, and the statistical results.

## How to replicate our experiment
To replicate the REMOTE condition of our experiment, go to the "documentation" folder of this repository. There, you will find a file entitled "Raspberry-pi_setup.md", which contains step-by-step replication instructions.

To replicate the ON-DEVICE condition of our experiment, click "android-runner_GreenLab_Project". This will take you to a separate repository for the on-device condition. Go to the directory "Experiment_OnDevice", then find the file "README.md". This file contains step-by-step replication instructions.

To run overall and unpaired statistical tests, use StatTests.r. To run paired tests, use PairedStats.r. Finally, to run descriptive statistics and create the plots used in our report, run DescStat.r.
